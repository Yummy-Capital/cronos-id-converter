Now, based on [cronos id converter](https://cronos-id-converter-ntwx6.ondigitalocean.app), we can see that Alice still owns `web3boss.cro`! Is it really? At least Alice can [make](https://cronoscan.com/tx/0x4b2eb17398d4cd2a9abd2b6715a0a4fcf4a9164fa2afae10ce730ca83cbe6cd4) changes for this domain ðŸ¤¯ At the same time, Alice cannot transfer the domain to anyone else, because the domain is actually in Bob's wallet.

###### We have checked several recent sales, as well as the very first one, and there is a similar problem everywhere.

Why then does [Minted Network](https://minted.network) display the correct owner? Most likely they use their own API, backed by their own indexer, which take into account transfer events.
